# SolarisSchema.github.io
A statistical overview of our cozy little space corner

We began this project as a submision for the congressional app challenge.
However, as the massive procrastinators we are, didn't even hear about the challenge until a month before it was due for submission.
About 18 days before the due date, we sat down and discussed what we were actually going to make and how.
11 days to go, and we finally started (keep in mind you normally have several months to design and submit your app).
Within 72 hours, we figured out what we could think of as the single most concise method of coding what we dreamed of, and fully integrated a massive database of statistics about every major body in the solar system, doing our best to stay as accurate and informational as possible.
I think we did pretty well.
And if you agree, then we thank you. It's been an interesting caffeine fueled journey for the three of us.
I can't speak for my two peers, but this is the path I've chosen to go down in my life. And I desperately want to learn and do more.
So please, feel free to leave comments on the repository, I'm sure my peers agree with me that we would all love to get in contact with others who have similar dreams or who have even already achieved them.

That's pretty much it
I don't know, I think that's alright
Thank you for visiting, and I hope you appreciate our work :)
